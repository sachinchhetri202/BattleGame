# BattleGame
CS1400 Class Assignment 

Create a simple RPG battle game similar to a Pokemon Go Gym battle. 
Both fighters start out with 100 life points. 
Every time you battle, your strength is based off a random number.  
You can decide how to set the algorithm for strength. 
If your strength is greater then your opponents, then he loses life points. 
If his strength is greater then yours then you lose life points (once again, you can decide the algorithm for how much life points they lose).
